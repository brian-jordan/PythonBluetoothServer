# PythonBluetoothServer
<img src="logo.png" width=500>
This repository contains support for writing Python programs to serve sockets over Bluetooth.  The code derives from
the term projects of four students in Washington and Lee's Spring 2018 course
<a href="https://home.wlu.edu/~levys/courses/csci251s2018/">CSCI 251: Android App Development</a>.  The students originally
wrote code to support controlling a servo on a RaspberryPi, with the control signal coming from a simple Android
app.  Eventually I was able to factor this Python code into an abstract Python
<a href="https://github.com/simondlevy/PythonBluetoothServer/blob/master/bluetooth_server.py">class</a>, with the
servo code implemented as a 
<a href="https://github.com/simondlevy/PythonBluetoothServer/blob/master/servo_server.py">sub-class</a>.
<p><p>
As a simple protocol, the server uses text messages delimited by a period ('.' character).   
For those without a Raspberry Pi or servo, a simple &ldquo;call and response&rdquo; 
<a href="https://github.com/simondlevy/PythonBluetoothServer/blob/master/lowhigh_server.py">example</a>
allows you to try out the code on an ordinary computer: your client sends period-delimited
messages containing strings representing the values 0 through 100 ('0.', '1.',
'2.', ..., '99.', '100.'), and the server sends back 'LOW.' for values below 50,
and 'HIGH.' for values above.  

I have tested this code on the following two platforms:

* RaspberryPi 3 (servo example and call-and-response example)
* Sony VAIO Pro running Ubuntu 14.04 (call-and-response example)

## Setup

On Ubuntu and other Debian-based OSs like Raspbian:

<pre>
sudo apt-get install bluetooth libbluetooth-dev
sudo python3 -m pip install pybluez
</pre>

On Raspberry Pi 3 you will also need to edit 
<b>/lib/systemd/system/bluetooth.service</b> and add <b>-C</b> after <b>bluetoothd</b>. Â Then reboot.

On Raspberry Pi 3 we also found it necessary to run the server as root; for example:

<pre>
% sudo python3 lowhigh_server.py
</pre>

The <b>sudo</b> was not necessary on other computers.

## Android client app

The easiest way to try out this code is with the [Android client app](https://github.com/simondlevy/BluetoothClient)
that we developed to work with it.  This app uses the same simple protocol as the Python server, and has been
tested with the servo and call-and-response examples.
